  If you really want to learn something teach it to someone else.  If you're
here because you want to learn, then do yourself a favour and write some notes
for others so you can learn it properly.   ;)  You'll also feel better about
the exercise because you'll be helping others.

  These files document how to install Fusion Directory 1.0, additional
modules and supporting software on a SINGLE Debian Squeeze server.  They
are valid shell scripts, but they're experimental so don't rely on them 
to work exactly as intended.

  If, after this warning, you still want to be lazy and just run these as
as scripts READ ALL OUTPUT VERY CAREFULLY.  Hopefully if (when?) something
goes wrong hopefully there will be some output to give you an indication. 

  These scripts/docs aren't perfect, and I would appreciate comments. I'm
usually on #fusiondirectory on FreeNode (an IRC network) for a few hours
(~7am[GMT]-
3pm[GMT]) every day so feel free to drop by to ask questions, comment or
collaborate.  My nickname is pav5088, and there are developers and users of
Fusion Directory who can also help.  My email address is at
the end of this file if you prefer.

  Some scripts/docs will need to be run before others.
squeeze-install-FusionDirectory-2.7 will need to run first, and the others
should warn+exit if a dependency hasn't been installed.

  The latest version of these scripts can be viewed here :
https://oss.gonicus.de/labs/gosa-contrib/browser/squeeze-install-scripts/trunk .
To check out from svn :
svn co https://oss.gonicus.de/repositories/gosa-contrib/squeeze-install-scripts/trunk squeeze-install-scripts

  There is some (minimal) extra documentation on using these scripts here :
